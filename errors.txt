Note that the levels have an order that is different from the order of appearance in the factor object. The default is for the levels to follow alphabetical order. However, often we want the levels to follow a different order. We will see several examples of this in the Data Visualization part of the book. The function reorder lets us change the order of the levels of a factor variable based on a summary computed on a numeric vector. We will demonstrate this with a simple example.

Note that the levels have an order that is different from the order of appearance in the factor object. The default in R is for the levels to follow alphabetical order. However, often we want the levels to follow a different order. You can specify an order through the `levels` argument when creating the factor with the `factor` function. For example, in the murders dataset regions are ordered from east to west.  The function `reorder` lets us change the order of the levels of a factor variable based on a summary computed on a numeric vector. We will demonstrate this with a simple example, and will see more advanced ones in the Data Visualization part of the book.

The list subsection (2.4.6) changed quite a bit. Better to look at new version. Here is what it shoudl be now:


Data frames are a special case of _lists_. Lists are useful because you can store any combination of different types. You can create a list using the `list` function like this:

```{r}
record <- list(name = "John Doe",
             student_id = 1234,
             grades = c(95, 82, 91, 97, 93),
             final_grade = "A")
```

The function `c` is described in Section \@ref{vectors}.

This list includes a character, a number, a vector with five numbers, and another character.

```{r}
record
class(record)
```


As with data frames, you can extract the components of a list with the accessor `$`. 

```{r}
record$student_id
```

We can also use double square brackets (`[[`) like this:

```{r}
record[["student_id"]]
```

You should get used to the fact that in R, there are often several ways to do the same thing, such as accessing entries.

You might also encounter lists without variable names.

```{r,}
record2 <- list("John Doe", 1234)
record2
```

If a list does not have names, you cannot extract the elements with `$`, but you can still use the brackets method and instead of providing the variable name, you provide the list index, like this:

```{r}
record2[[1]]
```


We won't be using lists until later, but you might encounter one in your own exploration of R. For this reason, we show you some basics here.

Although there are R packages designed to read this format, if you are choosing a file format
to save your own data, you generally want to avoid Microsoft Excel. We recommend Google
Sheets as a free software tool for organizing data. We provide more recommendations in
the section Data Organization with Spreadsheets. This book focuses on data analysis. Yet
often a data scientist needs to collect data or work with others collecting data. Filling out
a spreadsheet by hand is a practice we highly discourage and instead recommend that the
process be automatized as much as possible. But sometimes you just have to do it. In this
section, we provide recommendations on how to store data in a spreadsheet.

Although this book focuses almost exclusively on data analysis, data management is also an important part of data science. As explained in the introduction, we do not cover this topic. However, quite often data analysts needs to collect data, or work with others collecting data, in a way that is most conveniently stored in a spreadsheet. Although filling out a spreadsheet by hand is a practice we highly discourage, we instead recommend the process be automatized as much as possible, sometimes you just have to do it. Therefore, in this section, we provide recommendations on how to organize data in a spreadsheet. Although there are R packages designed to read Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, we generally want to avoid this format. Instead, we recommend Google Sheets as a free software tool. Below 
we summarize the recommendations made in paper by Karl Broman and Kara Woo^[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989]. Please read the paper for important details.

15. In answering the previous questions, we found that it is not at all rare for a seven footer to become an NBA player. What would be a fair critique of our calculations:
a. Practice and talent are what make a great basketball player, not height.
b. The normal approximation is not appropriate for heights.
c. As seen in question 3, the normal approximation tends to underestimate the extreme values. It’s possible that there are more seven footers than we predicted.
d. As seen in question 3, the normal approximation tends to overestimate the extreme
values. It’s possible that there are fewer seven footers than we predicted.

Question 3 should be question 10

The make_date function can be used to quickly create a date object. It takes three ar- guments: year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, and time zone defaulting to the epoch values on UTC time. So create an date object representing, for example, July 6, 2019 we write:

 make_date(1970, 7, 6)
